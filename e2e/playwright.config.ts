/**
 * Playwright configuration for the Bridgelet end-to-end integration test harness.
 *
 * These tests exercise the full user journey — create ephemeral account →
 * receive payment → claim funds — across the frontend (this repo), the
 * bridgelet-sdk backend, and, when available, a Stellar testnet contract
 * deployment from bridgelet-core.
 *
 * ## Running locally (all tests against MSW-mocked backend)
 *
 *   cd e2e
 *   npx playwright test
 *
 * ## Running a single browser engine locally
 *
 *   npx playwright test --project=firefox
 *   npx playwright test --project=mobile-safari
 *
 * ## Running against a real bridgelet-sdk instance
 *
 *   E2E_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
 *   E2E_USE_MOCKS=false \
 *   npx playwright test
 *
 * See e2e/README.md for full setup instructions.
